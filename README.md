# OpenPack
OpenPack provides you with open-source, free to use Minecraft-like textures and resources. Everything is compatabile with Minecraft; you can clone this repo and drop it in your resource pack folder and it will work as a regular Minecraft resource pack. You don't have to use this in Minecraft though; if you're making a Minecraft clone you can just grab these textures and use these for yourself!

## Contribution Guidelines
* Create a PR with your new/modified image(s) and/or generation scripts. All scripts should be written in NodeJS/TypeScript. 
* **Do not use any Minecraft assets.** Yours may look alike to Minecraft assets, but do not do things like recoloring, warping or flipping Minecraft assets.
* Do not stray too far from the vanilla look and feel. A build shouldn't look completely different in the vanilla resource pack than this pack.

Any contributions help; the textures don't have to be amazing! Having some textures is better than missing a texture. We can always replace the texture later if we don't like it.
